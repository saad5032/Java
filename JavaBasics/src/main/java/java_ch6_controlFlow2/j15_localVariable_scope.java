/*  
local variable - A local variable is called local, because it is available for use by the code block in which it was declared.
(we can make code block using curly braces or it can be if-block, for loop- block, method block etc.)  
The scope of local variable is block-level meaning it is not accessed/used outside the code block in which it is defined. 
    
Therefore, local variables are accessible in memory for temporary period as long as the code block in which they are declared 
is being executed, meaning local variable life span is equal to the code block execution time.

Local variables are stored in stack memory that works with LIFO (Last In First Out) process. Once execution of for loop starts,
memory of int i â€“ local variable, local to for loop block is created in stack and once for loop ends, the variable stack is taken out.
Thus, taking back the memory given to int i.
